# SelfMotionML

This repository will contain the codebase for a ML model of estimating self-motion parameters (See paper linked below for what self-motion parameters are taken to mean).

This link (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.09.451701v3) is the inspiration for the study.

The current goal is to take their NN structure and train it with different stimuli and with different methods.

1) Train it using human data during walking

2) Use deep RL methods to train an agent to move towards a goal location and concurrently estimate the parameters of its own self motion.
